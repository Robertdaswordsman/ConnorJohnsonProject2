Lab 2 Engo 551
I'm dissapointed in the lack of focused help in these tasks that are assigned to us. 
The last lab was fine, but there was an appalling lack of actual given help for this lab
The lab description was incredibly vague and the links were given with no context on how to actually use them properly. 

For this lab I tried to use the flask framework that we were using last time because that worked for a bit. However I still got stuck somewhere and it stopped working. 
The settup is essentially the same: a main app file drawing on the given templates and classes 
flask wtf was used to possibly accomodate the issues with the overlapping building points but I couldn't get that far.
